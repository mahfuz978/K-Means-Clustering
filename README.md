# K-Means-Clustering
**Skills used:** Python, sklearn, pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Project Objective:** Clean and organize the given data. Then, Cluster the data using a clustering algorithm and find a meaning or a message from the data.  

**Quantifiable result:** I was able to get 5 solid clusters.
- I used to the elbow method to certify the clusters.
- During the EDA I was able to reduce a lot of noises.
- I used data that was withing 2 standard deviation.
- I used WCSS algorithm to detrmine the optimal number of clusters.
